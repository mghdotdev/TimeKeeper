BUGS
----------------------
- 1. "Empty Record Name" alert, if not valid [a-z0-9] it says record input is empty. BUT its not
- 2. Basecamp? checkbox not loading from import
- 3. allow text to be selectable in-app
- 4. disable events after Basecamp? checkbox
- 5. Fix the breakage when you export whilst a timestamp is active.
- 6. Import does not allow the "remove timestamp" functionality. (events missing?)
7. CSS issue with Find button on Win/OSX... inconsistant padding due to spec. character
8. Fix issue with "Find" function not working due to new GUID update
