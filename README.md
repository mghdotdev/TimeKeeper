# TimeKeeper

### What is it?
TimeKeeper makes it easy to keep track of billable hours while working with clients. It also records your Admin time whenever a record is not active!

### How to use it
To get started either... Create a New Record or Import from a JSON File.

Once a Record has been created, you can Open a Timestamp and begin working.

After you're finished working press the Close button. The time elapsed will be rounded to the nearest 0.25 hour and calculated towards the Record total.
